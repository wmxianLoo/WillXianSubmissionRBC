Notes:
Personal Notes:
- Adpoted Singleton style for shared static variables and functions
- Decided to include a formatter for balance amount strings since it was covered in the previous coding round
- Balanced UI choices for code simplicity


Upon reflection, if I were to do the assignment again, I would do this differently:
- Make the transactions screen a fragment rather than an activity, this would allow me to handle screen rotations better
- Utilize background threads to also sort transactions and handle some of the work for transaction grouping
- Make progressive git pushes instead of a push all at once
